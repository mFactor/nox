As a generic OpcUa client, Nox needs to accomplish the following
* Connect, disconnect from any server
* Show entire address space, including Objects, Types, Views

* Show browse information
* OpcUa logging capability

As an enhanced client, some epic features would include
* Address space zooming
* Data visualizations
* IP address geolocation
* Data analytics and comparisons

We're pushing towards a V1 that will include basic client functionality
including connection management, address space browsing, and subscriptions.
